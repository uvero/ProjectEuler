#Problem 67
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent
numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3

7 4

2 4 6

8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt
, a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.

NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18.
It is not possible to try every route to solve this problem,
as there are 299 altogether! If you could check one trillion
(10^12) routes every second it would take over twenty
billion years to check them all. There is an efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)

## The algorithm
There is no need to run through every single path. Instead, here's the key:
starting in the second-to-bottom layer, each node "looks" down at its two
possible sons. The larger one is the one to choose, and so the node "adds"
it to iself (but in a **cloned** tree). Move to the above layer each time,
and viola!
